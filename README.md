## Description
Using the integrated terminal, this program will create a customized logo in svg format.

## Installation
To install, clone the repo from Github along with the necessary files to run node in your terminal.

## Usage
Load up the repo on preferred code editor, then open the integrated terminal by right clicking on the index.js file. Type in Node index.js and you'll be presented with a series of questions: logo text, text color, background shape, and shape color. Once answering those questions, the logo will be saved to the examples folder where it can be saved.
